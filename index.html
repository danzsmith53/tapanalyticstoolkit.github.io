| Analytics | **spark-tk:** Analytics library that enhances the Spark experience by providing a rich, easy-to-use API for Python and Scala. The library supports Machine Learning capabilities and other operations, for example, working with DICOM images. <br>[https://github.com/tapanalyticstoolkit/spark-tk](https://github.com/tapanalyticstoolkit/spark-tk) <br>  <br>**daal-tk:** [DAAL](https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/daal) models for Spark-tk library. Used along with Spark-tk frames, which provide an API for creating and manipulating frames of data. <br>[https://github.com/tapanalyticstoolkit/daal-tk](https://github.com/tapanalyticstoolkit/daal-tk) <br><br>**daal-utils:** C library for linking DAAL to daal-tk. <br>[https://github.com/tapanalyticstoolkit/daal-utils](https://github.com/tapanalyticstoolkit/daal-utils)  <br><br>**daal-parcel:** Parcel package files for installing daal-tk on CDH using Cloud Manager. <br>[https://github.com/tapanalyticstoolkit/daal-parcel](https://github.com/tapanalyticstoolkit/daal-parcel) |
| Models and Scoring | **model-archiver:** Model ARchive (MAR) format and interface for exchanging models, and the code to access them, between data analytics frameworks. <br>[https://github.com/tapanalyticstoolkit/modelarchiver](https://github.com/tapanalyticstoolkit/modelarchiver) <br><br>**model-scoring-java:** JVM-based Model Scoring Engine that supports scoring of Spark-tk and daal-tk models submitted in MAR format. <br>[https://github.com/tapanalyticstoolkit/model-scoring-java](https://github.com/tapanalyticstoolkit/model-scoring-java) <br><br>**scoring-pipelines:** Creates Scoring Pipelines that perform ETL data transformations before submitting records to a Scoring Engine. <br>[https://github.com/tapanalyticstoolkit/scoring-pipelines](https://github.com/tapanalyticstoolkit/scoring-pipelines)|  
| Jupyter Examples | **spark-tk-jupyter:** Docker image for Spark-tk in a Jupyter notebook. Notebook contains pandas-cookbook examples. <br>[https://github.com/tapanalyticstoolkit/spark-tk-jupyter](https://github.com/tapanalyticstoolkit/spark-tk-jupyter)|
